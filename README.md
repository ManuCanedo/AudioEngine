Blackjack Game (no graphics) with 3D audio (Audio Engine built in from scratch in C++/FMOD API).

Ambience Sound has been generated by mixing an stereo song with an ambisonic 4-track crowd sound effect. The ambisonic sfx got murdered in the process but the result stereo track was pleasant enough for me to be used as an ambience track (streamed from disk). To clearly differenciate the positions of the very basic 3D shuffle and card dealing sfxs I recommend choosing 7 players.

The AudioManager class handles loading, playing and stopping songs and effects, as well as managing the volume of the channels, fades in and out, generating random volume and pitch values within a range (to make sfxs less repetitive), setting up the listener properties and setting up a 3D reverb environement.
